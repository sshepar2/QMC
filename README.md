### VMC_H2

Variational Monte Carlo code determining average energy of an H2 molecule using a bond centered gaussian trial wave function.
This includes a serial version without classes, a serial version using classes, and a parallel version using classes.
The latter two versions are used to determine the optimal prefactor in the gaussian for a given bond length.
